To gain a deeper knowledge of our customers, we ran an extensive research project. Asides from conducting qualitative interviews, we analyzed quantitative data collected from the usage of the website together with secondary research data, such as benchmarking reports by the <a href='https://baymard.com/' target='_blank'>Baymard Institute</a>.</p>\n\t<p>The outcomes were visualized in form of user journey maps and user personas to support internal, interdepartmental communication. In combination with business requirements and development capacities we formed a monthly-reviewed product roadmap. From here we redesigned the whole store section by section.</p>\n\t<p>Each design change had to undergo an a/b test to assure the significance of its performance uplift, driving the optimization of the conversion rate. The usage of tracking software like <a href='https://analytics.google.com/' target='_blank'>Google Analytics</a>, <a href='https://www.inspectlet.com/' target='_blank'>Inspectlet</a> and <a href='https://www.optimizely.com/' target='_blank'>Optimizely<a/> supported our evaluation process.</p>\n\t<p>Over time we were able to establish a design system. This not only improve the consistency of the website, it furthermore crucially improved its performance. Revising the shop on a component basis also allowed us to improve the usability and accessibility of each entity.</p>\n"}
